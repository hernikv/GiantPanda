<p>
    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring mustelid.
</p>  
<p>
    Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
</p>  
<p>
    Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion
</p>  
<p>  
    In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
